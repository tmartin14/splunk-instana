### Installation
The installation consists of installing both the *Splunk Add-on for Instana* and the *Splunk App for Instana*.   
  - The Add-on is responsible for executing the rest API calls and collecting the data from Instana.  
  - The App provides a collection of dashboards and saved searches.  
  
To install, navigate to Apps --> Manage Apps and select the “Install app from File” button.  Specify the location of the file you downloaded and install it.   

### Configuration
The Splunk Add-on for Instana contains a global configuration for your Instana account URL and API authorization token.  

Enter those values on the **Configuration** tab in the Add-on.  You will find the settings in the **Add-On Settings** tab.

Next, create a new Input for the data you wish to collect via the **Inputs** menu -> **Create New Input** option.  Each Input requires 4 parameters:
  - Input Name 
  - Pollling interval
  - Splunk Index to use
  - Instana search filter that you would like to run (you can copy this directly from Instana's search bar)
  
  To retrieve metrics for all web applications and websites use this filter: 
```
entity.pluginId:logicalwebapp OR entity.pluginId:browserLogicalService
```
  To retrieve metrics for all databases: 
```
entity.selfType:database 
```

**Note:** This Add-on can be used for entities (Instana Snapshots) that contains the following 4 metrics:  
  - latency     ==> Average Response Time
  - count       ==> Calls per second
  - error_rate  ==> Error Rate
  - instances   ==> number of instances running this entity


### Start Searching
Once the Splunk Add-on for Instana is installed and configured you can execute searches using: 
```
sourcetype="instana:metrics"
```
